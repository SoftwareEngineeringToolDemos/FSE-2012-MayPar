/*** Kavit - Please follow the below steps to use the MayPar tool ****/

--------------
INSTALLATION
--------------
- Download one of the zip packages from:
 http://costa.ls.fi.upm.es/costabs/mhp/download.php

-unzip the file
unzip MayPar

-go to the executable directory
cd MayPar/bin

-now mark the file MayPar as executable with the command
chmod +x MayPar

-now run the executable file with the command
sudo ./MayPar

-we test the tool by running with the following command
./MayPar main -i '../examples/DemoExample.abs' -v 3 -mode complete -l



./MayPar main -i '../examples/PeerToPeer.abs' -v 1  -l -dot graph.dot

       Analyzes PeerToPeer.abs from the main method and creates a .dot graph.
       It does not compute the mhp pairs.

       
./MayPar main -i '../examples/DemoExample.abs' -v 3  -l -mode complete -type 'partial([27,49])' -stats

       Analyzes DemoExample.abs from the main method, it computes the mhp pairs only for the lines 27 and 49.
       It also prints statistics of the analysis.

where:

Entry : Is the method  from where MayPar starts analyzing.
	"main" to start from the main method or

[-input,-i]filename:Selects input program.
                    If no input is selected MayPar uses the last analyzed input 
[-mode,-m]complete: MayPar infers all the MHP pairs 
[-xml] filename:    Generates a xml with the results of the analysis 
[-dot] filename:    Generates a dot file with the graphical representation 
[-stats,-s]         Show some basic statistics 
[-lines,-l]         Program points are referenced with program lines 
[-v]  0-3:          selects the level of verbosity  
[-type]  reduced: Performs the analysis over all the program points where interleaving can occur.
         full: Performs the analysis over all program points.
         'partial([LineNumbers])': Performs the analysis over the selected program lines.
		                   These can be expressed as a list of line numbers and  intervals.
